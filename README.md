# Krust
This is a home-grown pet OS kernel. I'll try to write about its architecture and design
when I get at least somewhere near getting all it implemented.

The code is licensed under GNU GPL Version 3 or any later version, at your option.
Small support files (such as target definitions or manifest files) are distributed under
[Creative Commons Zero 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
To determine which license applies to a specific file, the following steps should be taken:

1.  If the file carries an SPDX license annotation, then the license defined by that
    annotation applies.
2.  If it doesn't, but the directory the file is located in contains files `README.md`
    and/or `COPYING` (in this order of priority), the license described in these files applies.
3.  Otherwise, the file is available under GNU GPL Version 3 or any later version.
